Exercise from my FE course on building a responsive website. Utilization of flexbox and rem key to make it responsive.

I may look into making the cards with a bit more space in a next iteration, otherwise feel free to branch and improve :) 

No media queries used for this one but as soon as I learn JS better I want to improve it and make it live.

#see you in space
